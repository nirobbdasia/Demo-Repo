Supar Keyward
===================

1.Supar Keyward is one of the Reserved keyward in java , super keyward is reference variable

2.Super Keyword can be used with variable , method and constractor

3.Super Keyword will be used when we use inheritance concept 

Super Keyword Usage
===================Scenario -1==========

1.with Variable 

 When parent Class and Child class has the same variable with same name if child class want to access the parent class
variable , in that case we will use super keyword

super.Variable


2. With Method
====================Scenario -2=========


When parent class and child class has the same method name and
if we want to call parent class method ,in that case we will use super keyword

super.method()
super.method(a,b)

3. With Constractor 
====================Scenario-3===========
Whenever we need to call base class constractor from child class,
We can ue super()

super()
super(a,b)


Few points to Remember for Super
============================
1.Super() should be first statement in derived class Constractor
2.If we do not call base class constractor then by default java intenally calls the base class constractor with zero argument
3.If base class does not have zero arguments Constractor then java throws Compile time Exception
4.When Child Class call Constractor of parent class and again if parent class calls constractior of grandparent class ,
Then this process is known as Constractor chaining
